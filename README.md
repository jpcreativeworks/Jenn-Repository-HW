## Discription

* This website is for Horiseon and reviews their elements of service that they provide.

* The html did have some non-definitive syntax and replaced it with more discriptive syntax

* Syntax-shmintax. 
I like to think of syntax as a deck of cards. Cards have a generic back to them with a pattern that indicates there is
a spade or a club behind it. But we wont know that until the div is revealed. But with the appropriate syntax that
is allowing the code to easily see the suit that it is, hearts, clubs, etc. This way the code can operate more efficiantly and optomize load time and clarity. 

*Eliminated repetive code for more direct classes and simplier readability

* Repetitive code is ... repetitive
Having repetive code can be hard to decifer and worrisome to eliminate. With usinging spaces commas and effectively we can combine appropriate classes, and identifiers (h3, img, etc) to combine elelements and make the page more efficiant. When I was reviewing this code I would note the classes that had the exact same attributes in my css code and then reclassify that repetive code so that it all reflects under the same class with it appropriate smaller, more discriptive, branches and leaves. 

* Challenges
* This assignment was more than just plugging and placing the correct classes and deleting stuff. This code was challenging when faced with code that was reacting to changes that i didn't know I had made or removed. After undoing many of my changes and working my way back that was when I could find were there were issues that I didn't even know about. But when plugging in the correct classes and headers it can get confusing.
